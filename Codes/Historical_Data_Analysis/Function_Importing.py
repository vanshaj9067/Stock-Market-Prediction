"""
Author: Madhurima Rawat

Script to generate a single import file (Import_Functions.py) that aggregates
function imports from individual .py files inside the 'split_functions' directory.

Each file is assumed to define a function with the same name as the filename.

The output file includes:
- A docstring at the top explaining the purpose
- Individual import statements
- A summary comment with total number of imported functions
