    ## Stock Market Overview

    The stock market is a complex system where investors buy and sell shares of publicly traded companies. Understanding fundamental concepts and terminologies is essential for navigating and analyzing market activities effectively.

    ### 1. **What is the Stock Market?**
    - **Definition**: A platform where investors can buy and sell shares of publicly listed companies.
    - **Components**:
    - **Stock Exchanges**: Physical or electronic venues where trading occurs (e.g., NYSE, NASDAQ, BSE).
    - **Listed Companies**: Businesses that have issued shares to the public through an initial public offering (IPO).
    - **Investors**: Individuals or institutions that purchase shares to gain ownership stakes and potential returns.

    ### 2. **Key Terminologies**

    #### a. **Stock (Share)**
    - **Definition**: A unit of ownership in a company.
    - **Types**:
    - **Common Stock**: Provides voting rights and potential dividends.
    - **Preferred Stock**: Typically no voting rights but has a higher claim on assets and dividends.

    #### b. **Stock Exchange**

    - **NASDAQ Composite**: Includes over 3,000 stocks listed on NASDAQ.

    #### d. **Bid and Ask Price**
    - **Bid Price**: The highest price a buyer is willing to pay for a stock.
    - **Ask Price**: The lowest price a seller is willing to accept for a stock.
    - **Spread**: The difference between the bid and ask prices.

    #### e. **Market Order vs. Limit Order**
    - **Market Order**: An order to buy or sell immediately at the current market price.
    - **Limit Order**: An order to buy or sell at a specific price or better.

    #### f. **Volume**
    - **Definition**: The number of shares traded during a specific period.
    - **Significance**: Indicates the activity level and liquidity of a stock.

    #### g. **Volatility**
    - **Definition**: A measure of how much a stock's price fluctuates over a given period.
    - **Types**:
    - **High Volatility**: Large price swings, indicating higher risk.
    - **Low Volatility**: Smaller price movements, indicating lower risk.

    #### h. **Liquidity**
    - **Definition**: The ease with which a stock can be bought or sold without affecting its price.
    - **High Liquidity**: Stocks can be traded quickly with minimal price impact.
    - **Low Liquidity**: Trades may significantly impact the stock price.

            The InfluxDB architecture utilizes a bucket system, which is pivotal for organizing data. In our project, we have a 
            primary bucket named <b>Stock Price</b>. Within this bucket, measurements help categorize and store data efficiently. 
            The first measurement is <b>stock_price</b>, which includes data points such as open, high, low, close, RSI (Relative 
            Strength Index), volume, and moving average, all indexed by time.
            <br><br>
            Another key measurement is <b>model_prediction</b>, containing values such as predicted high, low, open, volume, 
            predicted close, predicted moving average, and predicted RSI.
            <br><br>
            Both measurements include a <b>Ticker</b> column that holds the company ticker symbol, covering a total of eight 
            companies: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, NVDA, NFLX, META, TCS, and GOOG.
            <br><br>
            Initially, data is stored in InfluxDB, then queried and visualized using Grafana. The dashboard in Grafana is built on 
            top of this architecture, allowing dynamic data visualization. The diagram below depicts the general architecture of 
            InfluxDB.
